Hiking through mountain trails offers both physical exercise and mental clarity. Many hikers prefer early morning treks to enjoy the sunrise and avoid the heat.

Essential hiking gear includes sturdy boots, layered clothing, a hydration system, and navigation tools. Safety precautions such as checking weather conditions and informing someone of your plans are critical when exploring remote areas.

Nature excursions often reduce stress and improve overall well-being.
