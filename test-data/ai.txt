Artificial intelligence has progressed rapidly over the last decade. Machine learning models are now capable of understanding natural language, generating images, and even writing software code. Modern transformer architectures rely heavily on self-attention mechanisms to process sequential data efficiently.

Neural networks trained on large corpora can produce contextual embeddings that capture semantic meaning. These embeddings allow systems to perform similarity search, question answering, and summarization tasks.

Recent developments in open-source AI frameworks have made it easier for developers to integrate large language models into production systems.
